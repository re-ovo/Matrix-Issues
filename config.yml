## Log Violations
# Description: Logs all violations to a file. Files can be
# found in /plugins/Matrix/logs
# Warning: If you are using BungeeCord, I recommend setting
# this to FALSE. This will prevent useless log files from
# being stored and using up precious disk space.
log_file: true

## Deny Bypass Permission
# Description: By setting this option to TRUE, you are
# forcing Matrix to check everyone on the server, INCLUDING
# anyone who has Operator status. By setting this option to
# TRUE you can run the necessary tests without having to
# remove your operator status.
disable_bypass_permission: false

## Relog time
# How long after a player is kicked should he be allowed to log in (seconds)
# also, you can set -1 to disable this feature
relog_time: 5

## Disabled components
# You can disable a specific sub check here, instead of disabling
# the whole check, you can find component name in the end of verbose
# messages
# Example: If you add "speed.web" in the blow, the fast web check will
# be disabled
disabled_components:
  - 'example entry'
